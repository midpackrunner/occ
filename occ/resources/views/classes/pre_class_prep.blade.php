				<p>Wear comfortable clothing and athletic-type non-skid shoes; no sandals, flip-flops, boots or high heels. Dog training is a physical activity that requires a lot of moving around, though we can offer suggestions for those who need a different approach. If you don't have a treat bag consider wearing loose-fitting pants with easy access pockets to store your treats; no zip-lock or plastic baggies.</p>

				<p>
					Class can be a stressful and confusing place for your dog, and high-value food is an excellent way to keep him focused. Please do not feed your dog before class - motivating with treats works best when your dog isn't full. Bring several types of soft treats broken into pea-sized bits. Treats should be something special that your dog only gets during training sessions. Try several before the first class and see what your dog likes best. Popular choice include: Red Barn (available at Bone App√©tit in Chattanooga), steak, or chicken, jerky strips, cat treats, freeze-dried liver, cheese (string cheese in tubes works great!). Kibble, biscuits, or anything crunchy or extra chewy will take the dog too long to consume and won't work well in class.

			<div class="panel-body">
				<ul>
					<li>No refunds will be given after the first night of class, although credit for a future class may be permitted.</li>
					<li>Classes are progressive, so we strongly advise attending all classes. However, we know that other priorities can interfere. Please notify your instructor if you're going to miss a class to find out what will be covered.</li>
					<li>Female dogs in heat are not allowed in the training building or on the agility field.</li>
					<li>For everyone's safety, aggressive dogs (any dog that shows inappropriate challenge, threat, or contest to another dog or human) are not recommended for class situations. Handlers should work with the Training Director to determine alternatives.</li>
