        <p class="text-info"><strong>ASSUMPTION OF RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY</strong> I understand that, even when handled with care, other dogs may be difficult to control and may cause injury to my dog, my guests, or me. <strong>I agree to assume that risk and not hold OCC or its agents responsible </strong>. I also agree to be fully responsible for my dog, my guests, and myself, and to pay for any damage (including costs and legal fees) we may cause to OCC or others.</p>
		<p class="text-info">I hereby agree to indemnify and hold harmless this Obedience Club, its officers, members and agents from any and all claims, or claims by any member of any family or any other person accompanying me to any training class or function of the Obedience Club, or while on the facility or neighboring area thereto as a result of any action by any dog, including my own.</p>
		<p class="text-info">I also understand the potential health risk in exposing a dog or especially a young puppy, without complete disease immunity, to other dogs. I understand that it is my responsibility to provide all appropriate vaccinations AND understand that I may not bring my dog/puppy on the premises without current shot records.  I release the Obedience Club from any liability relating to this responsibility.</p>
		<p class="text-info">I understand that any children I bring with me are totally my responsibility and that OCC requires that I keep them with me at all times.</p>
