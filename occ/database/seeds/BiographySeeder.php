			'bio' => 'Susan Millican has been a member of OCC since 2014 and has been training dogs since she was 12 when she decided to make "Dog Care and Training" her 4H project.  She took her English Bulldog, General George S. Patton III to "dog school" at UGA and went on to win an Award of Excellence for her project.  Currently she owns a Jack Russel Terrier, George, and Parsons Russel Terrier, Jake. While Susan continued to train her own dogs, it wasn\'t until she retired, from 30 years in public education, that she was able to get back to her love of "officially" training dogs.
 
				Susan, George and Jake have earned their CGC certifications and Susan and George have earned their Therapy Dog title. Susan and George have worked together at Dade and Davis Elementary Schools and currently work together at Erlanger and Memorial Hospitals with oncology patiences. She and her dogs have also dabbled in agility and freestyle. 
 
				Susan teaches Beginner Obedience 1 & 2, Canine Good Citizen, and Therapy Dog. She has also served as OCC\'s Training Director.  "I believe God created these wonderful creatures to teach us about unconditional love.  I see this every time my dogs come running in with tails wagging so excited to see me even though I just left the room two minutes prior.  I see this every time I see George snuggle on the bed with a patient at the hospital and the patient begins to smile for the first time that week. I believe it is through consistent training  that our dogs are able to reach their potential and we are able to love deeper."
 
			Susan is an Adjunct Professor at the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga and loves to worship Jesus at Calvary Chapel in Chattanooga. In addition to dogs, she loves spending time decorating & remodeling her home, gardening, watching the birds, riding bikes, and traveling with her wonderful husband.',

			'bio' => 'A little Toy Manchester Terrier, "Toby", was Fay Taylor\'s first dog, a gift from her parents when she was 8 years old.  Having memorized a little "How to Train Your Dog" booklet, she began on Toby.  He became the neighborhood star - the only dog around that could sit, stay, go to box, go to kitchen, come, and lie down.

Over the years Fay and her husband, George, have owned, trained, and shown numerous breeds including Toy Manchesters, Bulldogs, Dachshunds, American Eskimo Dogs, West Highland White Terriers, Great Danes, Shetland Sheepdogs, a Greyhound, a Rat Terrier, an Australian Shepherd, a Rat Terrier and several mixed breeds.

Fay\'s dogs have been awarded four 4 Rally Excellent Titles, Two Obedience Utility Titles; The American Manchester Terrier Club Hall of Fame; Agility Excellent Jumpers and Open Standard; Canine Freestyle Federation Level IV and a Level II Brace (the first brace ever awarded by CFF); 3 Beginner Novice; 3 Pre Novice; 6 CGC\'s and 2 CGCA\'s; 2 Therapy Dog International certifications; 1 AKC Therapy Dog Novice title and 1 Conformation Champion.

			'bio' => 'Sharen and her soft coated wheaten terrier are new to the dog training world. She joined OCC when she first moved to the south in fall of 2014 and became a Board Member soon after.

Sharen has been parenting her fur kids since she was a small child and dressed them in clothes and wheeled them in her doll carriages, buggies, and wagons. She brushed their teeth, taught them to eat off silverware, and play games with her. They even had parts in plays she wrote when she was in grade school. They were always considered weirdly well behaved by neighbors, friends and family.

Sharen always wanted her fur kids to go everywhere with her. So she decided they would have opportunities to be included in family events as much as possible when she grew up. Blending the parenting concept with several traditional and non-traditional training techniques has made that possible. She now wants to share her training and experience with others and OCC has afforded her that opportunity.

She has shared her life with a golden retriever, Pekingese, cocker spaniels, cock-a-poos, yorkies, cats, rats, hamsters, and a horse, (commonly referred to as the largest lap dog ever.) She currently parents a soft coated wheaten terrier, which has titles as a Champion, Grand Champion, Canine Good Citizen Advanced, Therapy Dog, Neutral dog for testing dogs for therapy work, and Rally Novice.

When not at OCC, Quinn and Sharen test and observe canines and humans to become Therapy Dog Teams as well as provide therapy to a variety of populations. They go on walks in the woods, play hide-n-seek, and cuddle a lot.',

			'bio' => 'Katherine Taylor-Worth grew up surrounded by dogs of all sorts and sizes. As a small child, her parents had a kennel behind the house in which they bred and raised bulldogs. As time went on, and they ceased breeding bulldogs, the kennel runs in the back filled with a variety of dogs from neighborhood strays to Westies to Dachshunds. Her first clear memories, though, were of sharing the house with a Great Dane, named Duchess, and a Toy Manchester, named Brandy. Then, later, there was another Great Dane, named Summer. Summer was the first dog that she trained, and she remembers going to the Obedience Club of Chattanooga when it was meeting at the Armory in order to work with Summer. 

In 2008, Katherine returned to Chattanooga. She began working at Play Dog Excellent, and she also joined OCC. At that time, she adopted her dog Hal, as well, taking Hal from Julia, who is Hal’s foster Mom. In the time since, Hal has earned a CD and RE and has taught the entire household that SQUIRRELS ARE EVIL, of which fact the household was  dangerously unaware, as Hal explains daily. More recently, Stoner, a greyhound from the Birmingham racetrack, has also joined the family, and he has become a fiend for doing weaves on the agility field, though he is constantly attempting to explain how much FASTER he could go without all those obstacles in the way.

In the last few years, Katherine has taught Beginner Obedience I and II. She believes that most dogs learn best when given the opportunity to learn through positive reinforcement and that behavior problems are usually the result of poor communication between the canine and his human family, not intractable stupidity, stubbornness, or malice on the dog’s part.',
